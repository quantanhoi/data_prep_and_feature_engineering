== Categorical Variable
Categorical variables describe qualitative phenomena - they represent characteristics, qualities, or group memberships rather than measurable quantities. This is the fundamental distinction from quantitative variables.

Quantitative Variables::
Quantitative Variables measure amounts
- Stock price: $145.32
- Temperature: 25Â°C
- Height: 175 cm
- Age: 32 years

Categorical Variables::
- Industry sector: "Technology", "Healthcare", "Finance"
- Customer satisfaction: "Poor", "Good", "Excellent"
- Country of origin: "USA", "Germany", "Japan"


.Type of Categorical Variables
1. Ordered (Ordinal) Categories - have a meaningful sequence:
- Education level: "High School" < "Bachelor's" < "Master's" < "PhD"
- Customer rating: "Poor" < "Fair" < "Good" < "Excellent"
- T-shirt sizes: "Small" < "Medium" < "Large" < "X-Large"

2. Unordered (Nominal) Categories - no inherent order:
- Cuisine type: "French", "Indian", "American", "Italian"
- Blood type: "A", "B", "AB", "O"
- Car manufacturer: "Toyota", "Ford", "BMW"


.Numbers can be categorical
Categorical variables are independent from data type - even numerical values can represent categories when they don't have mathematical meaning.

Example:
**Postal Codes:** "64295" (Darmstadt) and "55118" (Mainz)
(Darmstadt is not 9177 better than Mainz)
These numbers are just labels; mathematical operations don't make sense

**Other Numerical Categories:**
- Employee ID: 10234, 10235, 10236 (not meaningful to add or average)
- Product codes: 1001, 2005, 3010
- Phone area codes: 212, 415, 617
- Jersey numbers in sports: 23, 45, 99
